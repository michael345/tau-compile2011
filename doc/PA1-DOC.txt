         DESCRIPTION OF CLASSES
         -----------------------

CLASS Compiler:
	The Compiler is the class where the main is.
	It basicly takes an IC filename as an input, and runs a while loop which scans over
	the IC doc until it reaches EOF or until it throws an error.
	On each char read from the IC file the Compiler outputs: LINE: ID(VALUE)
	unless ofcourse an error occures.

CLASS LexicalError:
	Extends Exception.
	This class represents a lexical error, and has a printMessage method
	which outputs to the console the line and error message recieved while 
	constructing the object by the IC.lex.
	
CLASS sym:
	Holds all Token ID's as integers.
	

CLASS Token:
	Implements the object Token. 
	
	It has 3 final private int fields: 
	(id) an integer representing its ID
	(value) a string representing its value
	(line) an integer which represents the number of line where
		the token appears in the IC file.

	the class containd getters for these 3 fields as well as the method
	toString() which returns a string which contains the information of the specific 
	Token.
	
	
CLASS Utils:
	Contains a simple function whose job is to recieve an integer and return it's 
	corresponding Token as set in class sym.

TESTING STRATEGY
-----------------
We wrote some interesting IC files, with all sort of edge cases (each file represents different edge case)
some are correct, meaning has no lexical error (maybe syntactic errors). Also worte these files expected output from the Compiler we wrote,
and checked weather the expected and the actual are equal.

BUGS
----
1) our error message says:"Unexpected input" insted of "Unexpected char"+'$' (for example) as stated in "Quicksort_bad".ic
   but since the exercise instructions didn't state the exact syntax of an error message we wrote it as we did.
